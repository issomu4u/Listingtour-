                        This is a three-step process.
                    </p>
                    <h5><b>Step 1: Fill in property information & upload property's main picture.</b></h5>
                    <p>When you click update, you will get an option to crop the property's main picture.</p>
                    <h5><b>Step 2: Upload property images.</b></h5>
                    <ul class="ha">
                        <li>You could upload up to 40 images for gallery and slideshow.</li>
                        <li> You could upload up to 4 panorama images.</li>
                        <li>
                            There are two ways of uploading images. If you want to upload images quickly, you can select the option "Upload multiple images at once"

                            If you are a perfectionist, you can select the option "Upload & crop an Image." This option allows you to upload and crop each image to perfection.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5><b>Step 3: Preview & Publish</b></h5>
                    <p>
                        In this step, you can preview how your virtual tour looks like. You can make further changes by clicking on the "update" button. If you like it, you can click on "publish" and the virtual tour becomes live on the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>Each virtual tour contains the following:</p>
                    <ol class="ha">
                        <li> <b>Property detail module:</b> Includes property's main picture, the property details and description.</li>
                        <li> <b>Panorama:</b> The highlight of the virtual tour is this immersive & interactive panorama feature.</li>
                        <li><b>Slideshow with music:</b> All the images uploaded by you are included in this slideshow.</li>
                        <li> <b>Gallery:</b> As the name suggests, it’s a gallery of images. </li>
                        <li><b>Map view:</b> Includes Google Street view and map view.</li>
                        <li> <b>Send tour:</b> You can send the virtual tour link through email to your potential customers by using this option.</li>
